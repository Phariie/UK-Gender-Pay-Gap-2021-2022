# UK-Gender-Pay-Gap-2021-2022

According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), in April 2024, the median hourly wage for full-time employees was 7.0% lower for women than men. However, for part-time employees, women earned 3.0% more than men on a median hourly basis. These figures exclude overtime pay. The median represents the midpoint in earnings, where half of employees earn above and half below, making it a more accurate measure of typical wages compared to the average. In April 2024, the median pay for all employees was 13.1% lower for women than for men.

The pay gap for full-time workers has steadily declined since 1997, and the overall gender pay gap has also decreased over time. Meanwhile, the part-time pay gap has remained small and negative, indicating that, on average, women in part-time roles earn slightly more than men.
